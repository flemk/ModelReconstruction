Analysis of time series from stochastic processes.

## ```stanpy.py``` - Stochystical Analysis Python
> Based on "Analysis of time series from stochastic processes" (by J.Gradisek, S.Siegert, R.Friedrich, I.Grabec)

> ```StochasticAnalysis.ipynb``` shows derivation of the code and some examples.

This module provides a class to determine drift- and diffusion-coefficients of n-dimensional time series by using their statistical definition.

### Usage
```python
import stanpy as sp

time_series = [[1, 2, ...], [1, 2, ...]] # your time seres you want to analyze

analysis = sp.StochasticAnalysis(time_series)
analysis.analyze()

# drift and diffusion coefficients are now stored in:
analysis.drift()
analysis.diffusion()

# you can visualize them in the 2d case:
analysis.visualize_2d()
```
