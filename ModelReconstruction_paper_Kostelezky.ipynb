    "The method of analysis of stochastic processes proposed in Ref. [1] is applied on two Langevin-equation-systems: The harmonic- and the Van-der-Pol-oscillator. Via the statistical definition [2] of the systems Fokker-Planck equation, drift and diffusion coefficients will be estimated. Further on the results derived by this method will be compared to the analytical result. Additionally the Fokker-Planck-equation of the systems will besolved using the estimated coefficients."
