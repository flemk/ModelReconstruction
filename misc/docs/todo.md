# What's still to do

- [ ] Correctness of transform function
    
    - [x] ```RESOLVED``` It may be incorrect: s. artifacts and index errors. But these seem to decrease with increasing bins.

    - [ ] 游린 ```TODO``` On Lorenz attractor it works perfectly fine, when it comes to the non-noised. when it's noised the function is misbehaving.

- [x] ```RESOLVED``` n-dimensional implementation

- [ ] 游린 ```TODO``` How to solve FPE in python?

    $$
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t} p(\vec{x}, t + \tau | \vec{x}, t) = (- \sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} D_i^{(1)}(\vec{x}, t) + \sum_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i x_j} D_ij^{(2)}(\vec{x}, t)) \cdot p(\vec{x}, t + \tau | \vec{x}, t)
    $$

- [ ] 游린 ```TODO``` How to actually derivate a field? 
$$
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} D_i^{(1)} \text{ and } \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i x_j} D_ij^{(2)} \text{ [1](2)}
$$

- [ ] 游린 ```TODO``` Is it true that
$$
    < a \cdot b> = < a > \cdot < b >
$$
If it's true, it'll make calculation of $D_{ij}^{(2)}$ easier.
